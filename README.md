# REQUIREMENTS

so you need vv, and you must have python installed. i mean it would be idiotic if you tried this with javascript 

```txt
 discord.py
 discord-py-slash-command
 googletrans4.0.0-rc1
 python-dotenv
 ```
 
# INSTALLATION


download the file and install them by doing in your powershell/command bar


```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt 
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
pythom3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt


```


you must be using 4.0.0 for google translate because google messed up the api in 5.0.0 update, or it might update to 3.0.0. 

^^ THIS MUST BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS YOUR PYTHON FILE
